# Digital Team Exercise Nr. 1

Build a project with [Nx](https://nx.dev) , having a UI ([Angular](https://angular.io/) ) and a backend (Node.js implementing [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) ).

## UI - Angular

Generate two components that communicate with a common store:

- One of them (the first one) has to have 3 buttons
- The second one must only show a text in a card
- When pressing each of the 3 buttons, a specific message must be emitted in the second component. Fixed for each of the buttons
- Include [Angular Material ](https://material.angular.io/) and use its components. (The idea is that what is shown in screen, has the styling of material).
  Use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Add some basic unit test with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- At the end of all these requirements, add a third component that has a button whose click emits an HTTP request to the API to get a random number generated by the API. Display this number in the same component
- Question for creating a debate: Regarding the random number, between component and service should we have a store?

## API - Node.js with Nest.js

- Generate a controller that has an endpoint that returns a random number.
